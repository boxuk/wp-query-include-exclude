# WP Query Include & Exclude

This package allows the editor to specify posts to include or exclude in a **Query Loop** block
when used in the Block Editor. 

The core block supports the include and exclude attributes, since the query loop uses `WP_Query` 
when rendering. Any attribute that can be passed to `WP_Query` can be included, so we use this
package to provide an interface to allow an editor to specify which posts should appear in a
query loop.
